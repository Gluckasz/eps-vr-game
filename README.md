## Project Information

This VR game, "Breaking The Silence," was created as part of the European Project Semester at FH St. Pölten. The dialogue and music featured in the game are original creations by the project team.

## Installation

To build and run "Breaking The Silence," you will need the following:

*   **Unity Version:** Unity 6000.x (ensure you have this specific version or a compatible one)
*   **Unity Build Support:** Android Build Support module installed in your Unity Editor.
*   **VR Hardware:** The game has been tested on Meta Quest 3. Other Android-based VR headsets might be compatible but are not tested

## Build Steps

1.  Clone or download the repository.
2.  Open the project in Unity Hub, ensuring you select the correct Unity version (6000.x).
3.  Ensure the Android Build Support module is installed for your Unity Editor. You can add modules via Unity Hub.
4.  In Unity, go to `File > Build Settings`.
5.  Select `Android` as the platform.
6.  Configure your build settings as needed (e.g., Texture Compression, Target SDK versions).
7.  Connect your Meta Quest 3 (or other target Android VR device) to your computer.
8.  Click `Build And Run`. Unity will build the .apk file and attempt to deploy it to your connected device.

## Game Overview

This immersive VR experience is designed to simulate a common family dinner scenario that escalates into a difficult conversation. Players take on the role of a family member and navigate the pre-dinner preparations before engaging in a challenging dialogue, often involving sensitive topics like racism.

## Purpose & Learning Objectives

The primary goal of this game is to provide a safe and interactive environment for social work students to practice and develop skills for handling difficult conversations, particularly those involving racism, that they might encounter in their everyday lives, outside of their professional work settings. It aims to help students:

*   Recognize and understand the dynamics of challenging interpersonal interactions.
*   Explore different conversational strategies and their potential outcomes.
*   Build empathy and perspective-taking abilities.
*   Gain confidence in addressing sensitive topics constructively.

## Gameplay

The game is divided into two main phases: the Pre-Dinner Gameplay (VR Exploration Phase) and the Core Dialogue Interaction.

### Pre-Dinner Gameplay (VR Exploration Phase)

Before the main dialogue with the father begins, the player will have the opportunity to move around the house, preparing for the family dinner. This serves both as an immersive introduction to the family setting and a way for the player to gather items or insights that may influence the conversation later.

**Player Actions & Interactions:**

*   **Setting the Table:**
    *   The player will collect plates, glasses, from the kitchen.

*   **Helping with Dinner:**
    *   The mother might make light conversation, giving hints about family dynamics (She might reminisce about past family dinners, mention how the father has been watching certain news channels lately, or subtly express concern about potential disagreements at the table).

*   **Exploring the House:**
    *   The player can move through different rooms, interacting with objects that reveal more about family members (photos, books, notes, etc.).
    *   These small interactions help develop the characters before the dinner conversation starts.
    *   The player may overhear snippets of conversations (e.g., the sibling on the phone, the father watching the news).

*   **Collecting Dialogue Items:**
    *   Certain objects found around the house can be used later in conversation.
    *   These might include news articles, books, or personal items that can support the player’s arguments or understanding of other characters' perspectives.

*   **Triggering the Dinner Scene:**
    *   Once the table is set and preparations are complete, the family gathers for dinner.
    *   The camera shifts to a seated position as everyone settles in.
    *   The conversation begins with small talk before a remark, often by the father, triggers the core gameplay interaction.

### Core Dialogue Interaction

Following the pre-dinner phase, the player will engage in a dynamic conversation with family members, particularly the father. The player's choices and dialogue selections will influence the direction and outcome of the conversation, allowing them to practice navigating challenging topics and de-escalation techniques.

## Target Audience

Social work students and professionals looking to enhance their skills in managing difficult interpersonal conversations in non-professional contexts.
